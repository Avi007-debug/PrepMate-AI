  "questions": [
    {{
      "id": 1,
      "question": "string",
      "category": "DSA | System Design | Behavioral | Core CS",
      "difficulty": "easy | medium | hard",
      "topic_tags": ["array", "sliding window"],
      "ideal_answer_brief": "2–4 sentence brief expectation of a strong answer."
